# US-HEART-PATIENTS
The objective of this project is to predict the occurrence of Coronary Heart Disease in patients after 10 years taking into account their medical data and lifestyle practices. The factors influencing the occurrence of the disease is also found out.

# Framingham Heart Study Dataset

## The Problem to Solve
Predict whether a patient has risk of developing coronary heart disease.

## How to solve it
Using classification machine learning models to predict. In this study in particular, I will go over Logistic Regression in detail to consolidate the knowledge on these tools.

## About the data
The dataset is from a cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham,Massachusetts. It includes over 4,240 records and 15 attributes.

The information provided by the dataset are:

Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke (Nominal)
Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive (binary - 0 - No, 1 - Yes)
Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes (Nominal) (binary - 0 - No, 1 - Yes)
Target variable:
